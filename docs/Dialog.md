# Dialog

# Introduction

A modal window overlaid on the page that requires user interaction before continuing.

# Props

## Dialog

| Prop | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `trigger` | `JSX.Element` | Element that opens the dialog when activated. |
| `title` | `string \| JSX.Element` | The dialog title. |
| `description` | `string \| JSX.Element` | The dialog description. |
| `body` | `string \| JSX.Element` | The main body content. |
| `footer` | `string \| JSX.Element` | Custom footer content. |
| `cancel` | `JSX.Element` | Element rendered as a close (cancel) trigger. |
| `confirm` | `JSX.Element` | Element rendered as an action trigger. |
| `closable` | `boolean` | Whether to show the close button. Default: `true`. |
| `interactive` | `boolean` | Enable client-side hydration for interactive behavior. |
| `class` | `string` | Custom CSS classes for the root element. |
| `role` | `"dialog" \| "alertdialog"` | Dialog variant. Use `"alertdialog"` for destructive confirmations. Default: `"dialog"`. |
| `aria-label` | `string` | Accessible name when no `title` is provided. |
| `closeOnEscape` | `boolean` | Close when `Escape` is pressed. Default: `true`. |
| `closeOnInteractOutside` | `boolean` | Close when the backdrop is clicked. Default: `true`. |
| `initialFocusEl` | `() => HTMLElement \| null` | Element to focus on open. Defaults to the first focusable. |
| `finalFocusEl` | `() => HTMLElement \| null` | Element to focus on close. Defaults to the trigger. |

Additional props (e.g. `open`, `defaultOpen`, `onOpenChange`, `id`) are forwarded to the underlying dialog primitive.

# Hydration

**Tier 1 — auto-interactive by default.** A `Dialog` has no meaningful static fallback — opening, focus trapping, and ESC handling all require client-side JavaScript — so it hydrates as an island by default. Pass `interactive={false}` to render a static, inert dialog shell that ships no client JS.

| `interactive` prop | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| omitted | Hydrates as an island (default) |
| `true` | Hydrates as an island |
| `false` | Static — no client JS |

All interactivity decisions in the library route through the shared `shouldHydrate()` helper in `app/components/ui/island-utils.ts`.

# Accessibility

Complies with the [Dialog (Modal) WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/). When hydrated (`interactive` defaults to `true`), the dialog ships the following behavior:

- **Focus moves into the dialog on open** — to `initialFocusEl()`, else the first focusable element, else the content itself.
- **Focus is trapped while open** — `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycle only within the dialog content. Nested dialogs are handled: only the topmost dialog traps and owns `Escape`.
- **`Escape` closes** the dialog (unless `closeOnEscape={false}`).
- **Background is inert** — everything outside the dialog (including a parent dialog behind a nested one) gets `inert` + is removed from the tab order, while the dialog subtree stays interactive. A module-level stack tracks nested open dialogs, ensuring only the topmost open dialog and its path remain active.
- **Body scroll is locked** while at least one dialog is open, and restored when the last one closes.
- **Focus returns to the trigger on close** (or to `finalFocusEl()` if provided).
- **Accessible name** — derived from `title` (`aria-labelledby`) or an explicit `aria-label`. A client-side `console.warn` is emitted if neither is present.
- **`role="alertdialog"`** — pass `role="alertdialog"` for destructive confirmations, and point `initialFocusEl` at the cancel/safe action so it receives focus first. With `closeOnInteractOutside={false}` the dialog can only be dismissed via a button or `Escape`.

# Usage

## Basic Dialog

```tsx
import { Dialog, Button } from "../components/ui";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Dialog
      trigger={<Button>Open Dialog</Button>}
      title="Confirm action"
      description="Are you sure you want to continue?"
      body="This action cannot be undone."
      cancel={<Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>}
      confirm={<Button>Confirm</Button>}
    />
  );
}
```
