# Getting Started with HonoX

HonoX is a powerful meta-framework built on top of Hono that enables you to build full-stack web applications with ease.

## What is HonoX?

HonoX combines the simplicity of Hono with advanced features like:

- File-based routing
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Islands architecture for interactive components

## Installation

```bash
npm create honox@latest
```

## Project Structure

A typical HonoX project looks like:

```plain
my-app/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── routes/       # File-based routing
  │   ├── components/   # Reusable components
  │   └── islands/      # Client-side interactive components
  ├── public/           # Static assets
  └── package.json
```

## Creating Your First Route

Create a new file `app/routes/about.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createRoute } from "honox/factory";

export default createRoute((c) => {
  return c.render(
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my HonoX app!</p>
    </div>
  );
});
```
