# Server Components & Islands Architecture

The islands architecture is a modern approach to building performant web applications by minimizing client-side JavaScript.

## What is Islands Architecture?

Islands architecture involves:

- Server-rendered HTML for static content
- Isolated interactive "islands" for dynamic components
- Minimal JavaScript sent to the client

## Benefits

1. **Better Performance**: Less JavaScript to download and parse
2. **Faster Initial Load**: HTML is immediately renderable
3. **SEO Friendly**: Full server-side rendering
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript

## Implementing in HonoX

Create an island component in `app/islands/Counter.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createIsland } from "honox/island";

export default createIsland({
  Component: function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
    
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {count()}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

Use it in your route:

```tsx
import Counter from "../islands/Counter";

export default createRoute((c) => {
  return c.render(
    <div>
      <h1>My Page</h1>
      <p>This is static content.</p>
      <Counter client:load />
    </div>
  );
});
```

## Best Practices

- Keep islands small and focused
- Use `client:load` only when needed
- Prefer server rendering for static content
- Use `client:idle` for non-critical interactivity

## Conclusion

Islands architecture provides an excellent balance between interactivity and performance.
